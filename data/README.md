# Data Directory

This folder is a placeholder for real fMRI ROI dynamic connectivity datasets. For the synthetic
demo provided with this repository the data are generated on the fly and no files are stored on
disk. To integrate real data please follow the guidelines in `README.md` at the project root and
implement the hooks defined in `dataio/roi_dataset.py`.
